# LiftKit SCSS

A fork of LiftKit CSS utilizing the power of the CSS preprocessors SASS to
address various issues with the code style and deployment.

Huge thanks to [@chainlift](https://www.github.com/chainlift) for designing
LiftKit, a framework utilizing the golden ratio to provide web pages with an
oddly-satisfying look and feel.

The aim of the fork is *not* to provide a simple drag-and-drop replacement for
LiftKit, but to enhance the source where possible, focusing on consistency and
ease of use. This means that LiftKit SCSS is not compatible with LiftKit
(as seen on the official documentation page) out of the box, although migration
is definitely feasible.

## Quickstart

Already familiar with LiftKit? Then download the latest minified CSS file
[here](https://github.com/Theikon/liftkit-scss/releases/download/v1.0.X/liftkit-v1.0.0.min.defaults.css).
If you are new to LiftKit, have a look at the documentation behind the design
philosophy over on
[chainlift.io](https://www.chainlift.io/liftkitdocs/overview).
Please note that there are some major and minor discrepancies between the fork
and the official LiftKit project as of the time of writing.

Feel free to reach out about any questions or feature requests by mail.
